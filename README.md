# PySoundSense

[SoundSense](http://df.zweistein.cz/soundsense/) clone for
[Dwarf Fortress](https://bay12games.com/dwarves/) written in Python. Should work
exactly like the original, with the exceptions of currently missing support for:

- `balanceadjustment` (not possible using `QMediaPlayer`)
- `randombalance` (not possible u sing `QMediaPlayer`)
- `volumeadjustment` (planned)
- `ansiformat` (planned)
- `ansipattern` (planned)
